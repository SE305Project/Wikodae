Populating the database â€“ python scriptIn order to populate the database, we have written a Python script to read the JSON file line by line and extract the information that we need. First we extract the entity ID and entity type, followed by the various languages supported, along with their corresponding descriptions. Once we have this information, we are able to populate both the entity and description tables. Using PyMySQL, we can connect to the MySQL database and effectively insert records. This is followed by the iteration of each property within the claims to populate the remaining tables. We extract information from the mainsnak and qualifiers to insert into the mainsnak table and qualifier table respectively. Then, we deal with the various types of data values that we may encounter in the mainsnaks and qualifiers. This includes string, wikibase-entityid, time, globecoordinate, and quantity types. For each type, we extract the necessary fields needed to populate the corresponding table. We insert these records in the same fashion as before, and continue on to the next iteration.
